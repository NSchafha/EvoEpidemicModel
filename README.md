# Research Project - Epidemic Modeling with Evolutionary Algorithms and Neural Networks 

## The idea
Using the individuals and their 'brains' from biosim4, and an SIR epidemic model was implemented over top of the code, the goal for this project is to attempt to simulate how real life populations interact throughout an epidemic.

## Results
While the project is not fully comeplete, results found were similar to what one migth expect.
Over generations, individuals begin to avoid eachother. Even if it is slight. 
This is expected as in real life, we may assume that anyone we interact with could carry a virus currently being spread. So naturally, we take try measures to limit our contact.
